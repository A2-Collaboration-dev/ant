#gStyle01
Drawing Canvases (from PhysicsManager::Finish()) crashes because gSytle==nullptr
if a TCutG was loaded from a ROOT File before, as done for ParticleID.
Although gStyle is valid before TRint is created.
Fix: make sure gStyle is not null after creating the TRint instance.
Although styles set in rootlogon.C don;t work anymore *arrgh*
