#gStyle01
Drawing Canvases (from PhysicsManager::Finish()) crashes because gSytle==nullptr
if a TCutG was loaded from a ROOT File before, as done for ParticleID.
Although gStyle is valid before TRint is created.
Fix: make sure gStyle is not null after creating the TRint instance.
Although styles set in rootlogon.C don;t work anymore *arrgh*

#matrixstack::vector01
ant.cc crashes on exit when run in "gui"/non-batch mode.
somehere in the destruction of matrixstack::vector. Probably
together with TRint cleanups.
